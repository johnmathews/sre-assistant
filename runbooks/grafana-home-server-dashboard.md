# Grafana "Home Server" Dashboard Reference

## Purpose

This is the primary Grafana dashboard for monitoring the entire homelab. It covers power, storage, compute, networking,
DNS, logs, UPS, temperatures, and container health. **The SRE agent must be able to answer any question this dashboard
can answer.**

Dashboard UID: `dekkfibh9454wb` | Auto-refresh: 10s | Default range: 24h

## Data Sources

| Alias      | Type       | UID              | Used By                 |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Prometheus | prometheus | `cethp6u3gnwg0b` | All panels except logs  |
| Loki       | loki       | `aezz63my8sj5sa` | Log Counts by Level     |
| Grafana    | grafana    | `-- Grafana --`  | UPS Alerts, Disk Alerts |

## Template Variables

### `$hostname` (multi-select, default: All)

- Query: `label_values(pve_guest_info, name)`
- Selects VM/LXC guests by name. Filters panels: CPU per VM/LXC, Memory per VM/LXC, CPU per Container, Memory per
  Container, Log Counts, Share Drive State, Container State.

### `$min_log_level` (custom dropdown, default: warn)

- Options: trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal
- Each option maps to a regex matching that level and above (e.g. warn = `warn|error|fatal`)
- Filters the Log Counts by Level panel

## Panels — Detailed Reference

### 1. Tech Shelf Power (row 0, left)

**What it shows:** Real-time and smoothed power consumption of the entire tech shelf (server, NAS, networking gear, UPS)
measured by a Home Assistant smart plug. Normal idle ~70W. Thresholds: 73W=warm, 76W=elevated, 80W+=high.

**Metric:** `homeassistant_sensor_power_w{entity="sensor.tech_shelf_power"}` — raw reading. Use `avg_over_time(...[60m])`
for 1hr, `[3d]` for 3-day, `[14d]` for 14-day moving averages.

**Agent capability:** Answer "what's the current power draw?", "what's the average power this week?", "is power
consumption trending up or down?", "has power usage changed recently?"

---

### 2. HDD State (row 0, right)

**What it shows:** State-timeline of each physical HDD across Proxmox and TrueNAS — spinning vs standby.

**Metric:** `disk_power_state{type="hdd"}` — states: 0=Standby, 1=Idle, 2=Active/Idle, 6=Active, 7=Sleep, -1=Unknown,
-2=Error. Use `hdd_power_status` tool (not raw Prometheus) for best results.

**Disks:** tank pool (2 HDDs on TrueNAS), backup pool (2 HDDs on TrueNAS), Proxmox backup (1 HDD).

**Agent capability:** Answer "are the HDDs spinning?", "how long have the tank disks been idle?", "when did the backup
disks last spin up?", "are any disks in error state?"

---

### 3. AdGuard Queries per Host per Minute (row 8, left)

**What it shows:** DNS query rate per client device, from AdGuard Home DNS.

generating unusual DNS traffic?"

---

### 4. Total Spindowns (row 8, right — table)

**What it shows:** Table counting HDD spin-down events over 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day windows. Helps track disk wear/power
cycling.

**Queries (all instant, table format):**

-- 7 days
sum by (disk) (label_join(sum_over_time(disk:spindown_event:1[7d]), "disk", " - ", "hostname", "disk_id")) / 2

-- 30 days
sum by (disk) (label_join(sum_over_time(disk:spindown_event:1[30d]), "disk", " - ", "hostname", "disk_id")) / 2
```

**Note:** Uses recording rule `disk:spindown_event:1`. Divided by 2 to correct for duplicate counting.

the most spindown cycles?"
