# Traefik Reverse Proxy

## Purpose

Traefik handles ingress for public-facing services (Immich, Jellyfin) that are exposed through the Cloudflare Tunnel. It
provides rate limiting on authentication and API routes since these services bypass Cloudflare Zero Trust access
policies.

## Architecture

```
Internet -> Cloudflare Edge -> Cloudflare Tunnel -> cloudflared LXC (192.168.2.101)
    -> Traefik (192.168.2.108, Docker) -> Backend services
```

- Only port 443 is exposed to the public internet (via Cloudflare proxy)
- Traefik applies rate limiting to auth/API routes for Immich and Jellyfin
- Traefik runs as a Docker container on a dedicated LXC (192.168.2.108)
- Configuration is file-based (dynamic config in `/srv/apps/traefik/`)
- Dashboard: https://traefik.itsa.pizza/dashboard/
- API overview: https://traefik.itsa.pizza/api/overview

### Services routed through Traefik

| Service  | Backend Address       | Rate Limited |
|----------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Immich   | http://192.168.2.113  | Auth routes |
| Jellyfin | http://192.168.2.105:8096 | Auth routes |

## Key Commands

### Check Traefik status

```sh
ssh traefik  # root@192.168.2.108
docker ps | grep traefik
docker logs traefik --tail 50
```

### View active routers and services

```sh
# From any host on the network
curl -s https://traefik.itsa.pizza/api/http/routers | jq '.[].name'
curl -s https://traefik.itsa.pizza/api/http/services | jq '.[].name'
```

## Prometheus Metrics

Traefik exposes built-in Prometheus metrics when configured.

```promql
# Request rate by service
rate(traefik_service_requests_total[5m])

# Request duration (p95) by service
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(traefik_service_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# Error rate (4xx + 5xx) by service
rate(traefik_service_requests_total{code=~"4..|5.."}[5m])

# Open connections
traefik_service_open_connections

# Host-level health (Traefik LXC)
up{instance=~".*108.*"}
rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{instance=~".*108.*", mode!="idle"}[5m])
```

### Agent strategy for "why is a service slow?"

1. Check Traefik container is running: Loki logs `{hostname=~".*traefik.*"} |= "error"`
2. Check request latency: `histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(traefik_service_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))`
3. Check error rate: `rate(traefik_service_requests_total{code=~"5.."}[5m])` — high 5xx = backend issue
4. Check the backend service directly (Immich, Jellyfin) to isolate whether latency is Traefik or backend
5. Check the cloudflared tunnel — if Traefik metrics look normal, the bottleneck may be upstream

## Troubleshooting

### Service unreachable through Cloudflare

1. Verify cloudflared tunnel is up (see cloudflared-tunnel runbook)
2. Check Traefik container is running: `docker ps | grep traefik`
3. Check Traefik logs for routing errors: `docker logs traefik --tail 100`
4. Verify Traefik config has correct backend service addresses
5. Test backend service directly from the Traefik LXC: `curl http://<backend-ip>:<port>`
6. Check Traefik dashboard for the service's router status

### Rate limiting too aggressive

1. Check Traefik middleware configuration for rate limit settings
2. Review Traefik access logs for blocked requests (HTTP 429 responses)
3. Adjust rate limit values in the Traefik dynamic config file
4. Check if a legitimate client is hitting limits (correlate with Loki access logs)

### TLS certificate issues

1. Traefik handles TLS termination for the Cloudflare tunnel
2. Check certificate status in Traefik dashboard
3. If certs expired, check ACME/Let's Encrypt resolver logs: `docker logs traefik | grep -i acme`

### Routing misconfiguration

1. Check active routers via API: `curl -s https://traefik.itsa.pizza/api/http/routers | jq`
2. Look for routers with `status: disabled` or priority conflicts
3. Verify host rules match the expected domain names
4. Check middleware chain order (rate limiting should come after auth headers)
